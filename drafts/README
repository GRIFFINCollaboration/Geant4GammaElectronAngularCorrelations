This is ALL the source files I've been working from, including all the tracing and poor documentation that I'm responsible for.
It is recommended that you use the cleaned up versions of the source code in photon_evaporation and radioactive_decay.

This directory is here if something goes wrong with the cleaned up version. These files should definitely work.
Delete this directory if it takes up too much space.
